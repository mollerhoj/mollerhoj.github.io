About
----------------
I have been programming since my early teenage years. I am interested in most topics in Computer Science: From Algorithms and Data Structures to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I enjoy teaching and explaining these topics to laymen. I have academic experience with most common (and semi-common) programming languages. I write clean, test-driven, idiomatic code. I have proffesionel experience working with distributed, agile development teams, defining APIs, integrating third party services and refactoring monolithic systems. I have experience working for startup companies, as well as starting my own companies.

My tools of choice as of early 2018 are:

- Git for version control
- Neovim for as editor
- Ruby on Rails for basic CRUD applications
- Python for Machine Learning
- PostgreSQL as SQL database
- Heroku for hosting
- Haskell for serious parsing

Degrees
----------------
I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Software Development from the IT University of Copenhagen. [This pdf](/files/bachelors_degree.pdf) shows my courses and grades. For my Bachelor Project I parallelized pension reserve calculations and moved the calculations to the GPU. 

I hold a Master's Degree in Computer Science from The University of Copenhagen. [This pdf](/files/master/masters_degree.pdf) shows my courses and grades. For my Master's Thesis project I optimized the Stanford NLP tool SPIED and calibrated the system to extract information from Danish corpora.
