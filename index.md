About
----------------

I have been programming since my early teenage years. I am interested in most of the topics of computer science: From algorithms and data structures to artificial intelligence and machine learning. I enjoy teaching these topics, and have experience explaining in explaining theortically advanced topics to laymen. I have academic experience most common (and semi-common) programming languages. I have experience in working with distributed, agile development teams. I write clean, test driven and idiomatic code. I have experience defining RESTful APIs, integrating third party services, updating legacy systems and refactoring monolithic systems. For my bachelor project I parallelized pension reserve calculations and moved the calculations to the GPU. For my masters thesis I optimized the Stanford NLP tool SPIED and calibrated the system to extract information from Danish corpora.

My weapons of choice are:

- Git for version control
- Neovim for as editor
- Ruby on Rails for basic CRUD applications
- Python for Machine Learning
- PostgreSQL as SQL database
- Heroku for hosting
- Haskell for serious parsing
