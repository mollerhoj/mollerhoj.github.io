Jens Dahl Møllerhøj, danish software developer and wannabe hacker. Computer Science is a great passion of mine.

I write, read and speak Danish and English as well as a long list of programming languages.

I have a bachelor degree in software development from the IT University of Copenhagen. [This pdf](/files/bachelor_degree.pdf) shows my courses and grades.

Appart from Computer Science, I am interested in 80's style computer games, fonts, graphic design, philosophy, and music.
